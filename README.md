# Neural-Network-Binary-Classifier
In this project, we work on Hotel Cancellation data, 
first, we do some data pre-processing including Standardisation of numerical features and Encoding of categorical features, 
and finally we build a Neural Network model (in Keras) to predict the status (cancelled 1 or not-cancelled 0) of hotel reservation.
